### Roadmap 4: Managing Resources with Scope and Layer

**Introduction:**

In software, a **resource** is any component that has a defined lifecycle—it must be explicitly **acquired** before use and **released** after use. Properly managing this lifecycle is critical to prevent common and severe bugs like memory leaks, file corruption, and exhausted connection pools.

Common examples of resources include:
*   Database connection pools
*   Individual database transactions
*   File handles
*   Network sockets and HTTP clients
*   Locks and mutexes

**In native TypeScript**, resource management typically relies on `try...finally` blocks, often combined with `async/await`. This approach, however, becomes brittle in complex applications. It's difficult to compose the lifecycles of multiple resources, and more importantly, it cannot gracefully handle interruptions—if an asynchronous `Promise` is cancelled, there is no standard mechanism to ensure its `finally` block is executed immediately.

This roadmap explores Effect's first-class solution for resource management. By using `Scope` and `Layer`, Effect makes resource safety declarative, composable, and automatic, guaranteeing that resources are always released correctly, even in the face of errors or interruptions.

**Goal:** To master the patterns for safely acquiring, using, and releasing resources. This roadmap focuses on creating robust, leak-proof services (like database connection pools or HTTP clients) by integrating resource lifecycles directly into the dependency injection system.
