## Guideline

To handle a data source that is split across multiple pages, use `Stream.paginateEffect` to abstract the pagination logic into a single, continuous `Stream`.

---

## Rationale

Calling paginated APIs is a classic programming challenge. It often involves writing complex, stateful, and imperative code with manual loops to fetch one page, check if there's a next page, fetch that page, and so on, all while accumulating the results. This logic is tedious to write and easy to get wrong.

`Stream.paginateEffect` elegantly solves this by declaratively modeling the pagination process:

1.  **Declarative and Stateless**: You provide a function that knows how to fetch a single page, and the `Stream` handles the looping, state management (the current page token/number), and termination logic for you. Your business logic remains clean and stateless.
2.  **Lazy and Efficient**: The stream fetches pages on demand as they are consumed. If a downstream consumer only needs the first 20 items, the stream will only make enough API calls to satisfy that need, rather than wastefully fetching all pages upfront.
3.  **Fully Composable**: The result is a standard `Stream`. This means you can pipe the continuous flow of items directly into other powerful operators like `mapEffect` for concurrent processing or `grouped` for batching, without ever thinking about page boundaries again.

## Good Example

This example simulates fetching users from a paginated API. The `fetchUsersPage` function gets one page of data and returns the next page number. `Stream.paginateEffect` uses this function to create a single stream of all users across all pages.

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to write manual, imperative logic to handle the pagination loop. This code is stateful, harder to read, and not composable.

```typescript
import { Effect, Chunk, Option } from 'effect';
// ... same mock API setup ...

const fetchAllUsersManually = (): Effect.Effect<Chunk.Chunk<User>, Error> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Manual state management for results and current page
    let allFetchedUsers: User[] = [];
    let currentPage: Option.Option<number> = Option.some(1);

    // Manual loop to fetch pages
    while (Option.isSome(currentPage)) {
      const [users, nextPage] = yield* fetchUsersPage(currentPage.value);
      allFetchedUsers = allFetchedUsers.concat(Chunk.toArray(users));
      currentPage = nextPage;
    }

    return Chunk.fromIterable(allFetchedUsers);
  });

const program = fetchAllUsersManually().pipe(
  Effect.map((users) => users.length)
);

Effect.runPromise(program).then((totalUsers) => {
  console.log(`Total users fetched from all pages: ${totalUsers}`);
});
```

This manual approach is inferior because it forces you to manage state explicitly (`allFetchedUsers`, `currentPage`). The logic is contained within a single, monolithic effect that is not lazy and cannot be easily composed with other stream operators without first collecting all results. `Stream.paginateEffect` abstracts away this entire block of boilerplate code.
