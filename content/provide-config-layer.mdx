# Provide Configuration to Your App via a Layer

## Guideline

Transform your configuration schema into a `Layer` using `Config.layer()` and provide it to your main application `Effect`.

## Rationale

Integrating configuration as a `Layer` plugs it directly into Effect's dependency injection system. This makes your configuration available anywhere in the program and dramatically simplifies testing by allowing you to substitute mock configuration.

## Good Example

````typescript
import { Config, Effect, Layer } from "effect";

const ServerConfig = Config.all({ port: Config.number("PORT") });

const program = Effect.log("Application starting...");

const configLayer = Config.layer(ServerConfig);

const runnable = Effect.provide(program, configLayer);
````

**Explanation:**  
This approach makes configuration available contextually, supporting better testing and modularity.

## Anti-Pattern

Manually reading environment variables deep inside business logic. This tightly couples that logic to the external environment, making it difficult to test and reuse.
