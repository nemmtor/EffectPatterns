## Guideline

To return a JavaScript object or value as a JSON response, use the `Http.response.json(data)` constructor.

---

## Rationale

APIs predominantly communicate using JSON. The `Http` module provides a dedicated `Http.response.json` helper to make this as simple and robust as possible. Manually constructing a JSON response involves serializing the data and setting the correct HTTP headers, which is tedious and error-prone.

Using `Http.response.json` is superior because:

1.  **Automatic Serialization**: It safely handles the `JSON.stringify` operation for you, including handling potential circular references or other serialization errors.
2.  **Correct Headers**: It automatically sets the `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` header. This is critical for clients to correctly interpret the response body. Forgetting this header is a common source of bugs in manually constructed APIs.
3.  **Simplicity and Readability**: Your intent is made clear with a single, declarative function call. The code is cleaner and focuses on the data being sent, not the mechanics of HTTP.
4.  **Composability**: It creates a standard `Http.response` object that works seamlessly with all other parts of the Effect `Http` module.

## Good Example

This example defines a route that fetches a user object and returns it as a JSON response. The `Http.response.json` function handles all the necessary serialization and header configuration.

<Example path="./src/send-json-response.ts" />

## Anti-Pattern

The anti-pattern is to manually serialize the data to a string and set the headers yourself. This is verbose and introduces opportunities for error.

```typescript
import { Effect } from 'effect';
import { Http, NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from '@effect/platform-node';

const getUserRoute = Http.router.get(
  '/users/1',
  Effect.succeed({ id: 1, name: 'Paul', team: 'Effect' }).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((user) => {
      // Manually serialize the object to a JSON string.
      const jsonString = JSON.stringify(user);
      // Create a text response with the string.
      const response = Http.response.text(jsonString);
      // Manually set the Content-Type header.
      return Effect.succeed(
        Http.response.setHeader(
          response,
          'Content-Type',
          'application/json; charset=utf-8'
        )
      );
    })
  )
);

const app = Http.router.empty.pipe(Http.router.addRoute(getUserRoute));

const program = Http.server.serve(app).pipe(
  Effect.provide(NodeHttpServer.layer({ port: 3000 }))
);

NodeRuntime.runMain(program);
```

This manual approach is unnecessarily complex. It forces you to remember to perform both the serialization and the header configuration. If you forget the `setHeader` call, many clients will fail to parse the response correctly. The `Http.response.json` helper eliminates this entire class of potential bugs.
