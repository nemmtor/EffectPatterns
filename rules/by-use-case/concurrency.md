# Concurrency Patterns

## Add Caching by Wrapping a Layer

Use a wrapping Layer to add cross-cutting concerns like caching to a service without altering its original implementation.

### Example

We have a `WeatherService` that makes slow API calls. We create a `WeatherService.cached` wrapper layer that adds an in-memory cache using a `Ref` and a `Map`.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Ref } from "effect";

// 1. Define the service interface
class WeatherService extends Effect.Service<WeatherService>()(
  "WeatherService",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      getForecast: (city: string) => Effect.succeed(`Sunny in ${city}`),
    }),
  }
) {}

// 2. The "Live" implementation that is slow
const WeatherServiceLive = Layer.succeed(
  WeatherService,
  WeatherService.of({
    _tag: "WeatherService",
    getForecast: (city) =>
      Effect.succeed(`Sunny in ${city}`).pipe(
        Effect.delay("2 seconds"),
        Effect.tap(() => Effect.log(`Fetched live forecast for ${city}`))
      ),
  })
);

// 3. The Caching Wrapper Layer
const WeatherServiceCached = Layer.effect(
  WeatherService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // It REQUIRES the original WeatherService
    const underlyingService = yield* WeatherService;
    const cache = yield* Ref.make(new Map<string, string>());

    return WeatherService.of({
      _tag: "WeatherService",
      getForecast: (city) =>
        Ref.get(cache).pipe(
          Effect.flatMap((map) =>
            map.has(city)
              ? Effect.log(`Cache HIT for ${city}`).pipe(
                  Effect.as(map.get(city)!)
                )
              : Effect.log(`Cache MISS for ${city}`).pipe(
                  Effect.flatMap(() => underlyingService.getForecast(city)),
                  Effect.tap((forecast) =>
                    Ref.update(cache, (map) => map.set(city, forecast))
                  )
                )
          )
        ),
    });
  })
);

// 4. Compose the final layer. The wrapper is provided with the live implementation.
const AppLayer = Layer.provide(WeatherServiceCached, WeatherServiceLive);

// 5. The application logic
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const weather = yield* WeatherService;
  yield* weather.getForecast("London"); // First call is slow (MISS)
  yield* weather.getForecast("London"); // Second call is instant (HIT)
});

Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, AppLayer));

```

## Control Repetition with Schedule

Use Schedule to create composable policies for controlling the repetition and retrying of effects.

### Example

This example demonstrates composition by creating a common, robust retry policy: exponential backoff with jitter, limited to 5 attempts.

```typescript
import { Effect, Schedule, Duration } from "effect"

// A simple effect that can fail
const flakyEffect = Effect.try({
  try: () => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.2) {
      throw new Error("Transient error")
    }
    return "Operation succeeded!"
  },
  catch: (error: unknown) => {
    Effect.logInfo("Operation failed, retrying...")
    return error
  }
})

// --- Building a Composable Schedule ---

// 1. Start with a base exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms...)
const exponentialBackoff = Schedule.exponential("100 millis")

// 2. Add random jitter to avoid thundering herd problems
const withJitter = Schedule.jittered(exponentialBackoff)

// 3. Limit the schedule to a maximum of 5 repetitions
const limitedWithJitter = Schedule.compose(
  withJitter,
  Schedule.recurs(5)
)

// --- Using the Schedule ---
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Starting operation...")
  const result = yield* Effect.retry(flakyEffect, limitedWithJitter)
  yield* Effect.logInfo(`Final result: ${result}`)
})

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(program)
```

---

## Decouple Fibers with Queues and PubSub

Use Queue for point-to-point work distribution and PubSub for broadcast messaging between fibers.

### Example

A producer fiber adds jobs to a `Queue`, and a worker fiber takes jobs off the queue to process them.

```typescript
import { Effect, Queue, Fiber } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Starting queue demo...");

  // Create a bounded queue that can hold a maximum of 10 items.
  // This prevents memory issues by applying backpressure when the queue is full.
  // If a producer tries to add to a full queue, it will suspend until space is available.
  const queue = yield* Queue.bounded<string>(10);
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Created bounded queue");

  // Producer Fiber: Add a job to the queue every second.
  // This fiber runs independently and continuously produces work items.
  // The producer-consumer pattern decouples work generation from work processing.
  const producer = yield* Effect.gen(function* () {
    let i = 0;
    while (true) {
      const job = `job-${i++}`;
      yield* Effect.logInfo(`Producing ${job}...`);

      // Queue.offer adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full,
      // this operation will suspend the fiber until space becomes available.
      // This provides natural backpressure control.
      yield* Queue.offer(queue, job);

      // Sleep for 500ms between job creation. This controls the production rate.
      // Producer is faster than consumer (500ms vs 1000ms) to demonstrate queue buffering.
      yield* Effect.sleep("500 millis");
    }
  }).pipe(Effect.fork); // Fork creates a new fiber that runs concurrently

  yield* Effect.logInfo("Started producer fiber");

  // Worker Fiber: Take a job from the queue and process it.
  // This fiber runs independently and processes work items as they become available.
  // Multiple workers could be created to scale processing capacity.
  const worker = yield* Effect.gen(function* () {
    while (true) {
      // Queue.take removes and returns an item from the queue.
      // If the queue is empty, this operation will suspend the fiber
      // until an item becomes available. This prevents busy-waiting.
      const job = yield* Queue.take(queue);
      yield* Effect.logInfo(`Processing ${job}...`);

      // Simulate work by sleeping for 1 second.
      // This makes the worker slower than the producer, causing queue buildup.
      yield* Effect.sleep("1 second");
      yield* Effect.logInfo(`Completed ${job}`);
    }
  }).pipe(Effect.fork); // Fork creates another independent fiber

  yield* Effect.logInfo("Started worker fiber");

  // Let them run for a while...
  // The main fiber sleeps while the producer and worker fibers run concurrently.
  // During this time, you'll see the queue acting as a buffer between
  // the fast producer and slow worker.
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Running for 10 seconds...");
  yield* Effect.sleep("10 seconds");
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Done!");

  // Interrupt both fibers to clean up resources.
  // Fiber.interrupt sends an interruption signal to the fiber,
  // allowing it to perform cleanup operations before terminating.
  // This is safer than forcefully killing fibers.
  yield* Fiber.interrupt(producer);
  yield* Fiber.interrupt(worker);

  // Note: In a real application, you might want to:
  // 1. Drain the queue before interrupting workers
  // 2. Use Fiber.join to wait for graceful shutdown
  // 3. Handle interruption signals in the fiber loops
});

// Run the program
// This demonstrates the producer-consumer pattern with Effect fibers:
// - Fibers are lightweight threads that can be created in large numbers
// - Queues provide safe communication between fibers
// - Backpressure prevents resource exhaustion
// - Interruption allows for graceful shutdown
Effect.runPromise(program);

```


A publisher sends an event, and multiple subscribers react to it independently.

```typescript
import { Effect, PubSub } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const pubsub = yield* PubSub.bounded<string>(10);

  // Subscriber 1: The "Audit" service
  const auditSub = PubSub.subscribe(pubsub).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((subscription) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        while (true) {
          const event = yield* Queue.take(subscription);
          yield* Effect.log(`AUDIT: Received event: ${event}`);
        }
      }),
    ),
    Effect.fork,
  );

  // Subscriber 2: The "Notifier" service
  const notifierSub = PubSub.subscribe(pubsub).pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((subscription) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        while (true) {
          const event = yield* Queue.take(subscription);
          yield* Effect.log(`NOTIFIER: Sending notification for: ${event}`);
        }
      }),
    ),
    Effect.fork,
  );

  // Give subscribers time to start
  yield* Effect.sleep("1 second");

  // Publisher: Publish an event that both subscribers will receive.
  yield* PubSub.publish(pubsub, "user_logged_in");
});
```

## Execute Long-Running Apps with Effect.runFork

Use Effect.runFork to launch a long-running application as a manageable, detached fiber.

### Example

This example starts a simple "server" that runs forever. We use `runFork` to launch it and then use the returned `Fiber` to shut it down gracefully after 5 seconds.

```typescript
import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect";

// A server that listens for requests forever
const server = Effect.log("Server received a request.").pipe(
  Effect.delay("1 second"),
  Effect.forever,
);

Effect.runSync(Effect.log("Starting server..."));

// Launch the server as a detached, top-level fiber
const appFiber = Effect.runFork(server);

// In a real app, you would listen for OS signals.
// Here, we simulate a shutdown signal after 5 seconds.
setTimeout(() => {
  const shutdownProgram = Effect.gen(function* () {
    yield* Effect.log("Shutdown signal received. Interrupting server fiber...");
    // This ensures all cleanup logic within the server effect would run.
    yield* Fiber.interrupt(appFiber);
  });
  Effect.runPromise(shutdownProgram);
}, 5000);
```

---

---

## Implement Graceful Shutdown for Your Application

Use Effect.runFork and OS signal listeners to implement graceful shutdown for long-running applications.

### Example

This example creates a server with a "scoped" database connection. It uses `runFork` to start the server and sets up a `SIGINT` handler to interrupt the server fiber, which in turn guarantees the database finalizer is called.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Fiber, Context, Scope } from "effect";
import * as http from "http";

// 1. A service with a finalizer for cleanup
class Database extends Effect.Service<Database>()("Database", {
  effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
    yield* Effect.log("Acquiring DB connection");
    return {
      query: () => Effect.succeed("data"),
    };
  }),
}) {}

// 2. The main server logic
const server = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;

  // Create server with proper error handling
  const httpServer = yield* Effect.sync(() => {
    const server = http.createServer((_req, res) => {
      Effect.runFork(
        Effect.provide(
          db.query().pipe(Effect.map((data) => res.end(data))),
          Database.Default
        )
      );
    });
    return server;
  });

  // Add a finalizer to close the server
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      httpServer.close();
      yield* Effect.log("Server closed");
    })
  );

  // Start server with error handling
  yield* Effect.async<void, Error>((resume) => {
    httpServer.once('error', (err: Error) => {
      resume(Effect.fail(new Error(`Failed to start server: ${err.message}`)));
    });

    httpServer.listen(3456, () => {
      resume(Effect.succeed(void 0));
    });
  });

  yield* Effect.log("Server started on port 3456. Press Ctrl+C to exit.");

  // For testing purposes, we'll run for a short time instead of forever
  yield* Effect.sleep("2 seconds");
  yield* Effect.log("Shutting down gracefully...");
});

// 3. Provide the layer and launch with runFork
const app = Effect.provide(server.pipe(Effect.scoped), Database.Default);

// 4. Run the app and handle shutdown
Effect.runPromise(app).catch((error) => {
  Effect.runSync(Effect.logError("Application error: " + error));
  process.exit(1);
});

```

## Manage Resource Lifecycles with Scope

Use Scope for fine-grained, manual control over resource lifecycles and cleanup guarantees.

### Example

This example shows how to acquire a resource (like a file handle), use it, and have `Scope` guarantee its release.

```typescript
import { Effect, Scope } from "effect";

// Simulate acquiring and releasing a resource
const acquireFile = Effect.log("File opened").pipe(
  Effect.as({ write: (data: string) => Effect.log(`Wrote: ${data}`) }),
);
const releaseFile = Effect.log("File closed.");

// Create a "scoped" effect. This effect, when used, will acquire the
// resource and register its release action with the current scope.
const scopedFile = Effect.acquireRelease(acquireFile, () => releaseFile);

// The main program that uses the scoped resource
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Effect.scoped "uses" the resource. It runs the acquire effect,
  // provides the resource to the inner effect, and ensures the
  // release effect is run when this block completes.
  const file = yield* Effect.scoped(scopedFile);

  yield* file.write("hello");
  yield* file.write("world");

  // The file will be automatically closed here.
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
/*
Output:
File opened
Wrote: hello
Wrote: world
File closed
*/
```

## Manage Shared State Safely with Ref

Use Ref to manage shared, mutable state concurrently, ensuring atomicity.

### Example

This program simulates 1,000 concurrent fibers all trying to increment a shared counter. Because we use `Ref.update`, every single increment is applied atomically, and the final result is always correct.

```typescript
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Create a new Ref with an initial value of 0
  const ref = yield* Ref.make(0);

  // Define an effect that increments the counter by 1
  const increment = Ref.update(ref, (n) => n + 1);

  // Create an array of 1,000 increment effects
  const tasks = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, () => increment);

  // Run all 1,000 effects concurrently
  yield* Effect.all(tasks, { concurrency: "unbounded" });

  // Get the final value of the counter
  return yield* Ref.get(ref);
});

// The result will always be 1000
const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* program;
  yield* Effect.log(`Final counter value: ${result}`);
  return result;
});

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);

```

---

---

## Manage Shared State Safely with Ref

Use Ref to safely manage shared, mutable state in concurrent and effectful programs.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect";

// Create a Ref with an initial value
const makeCounter = Ref.make(0);

// Increment the counter atomically
const increment = makeCounter.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((counter) =>
    Ref.update(counter, (n) => n + 1)
  )
);

// Read the current value
const getValue = makeCounter.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((counter) => Ref.get(counter))
);

// Use Ref in a workflow
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const counter = yield* Ref.make(0);
  yield* Ref.update(counter, (n) => n + 1);
  const value = yield* Ref.get(counter);
  yield* Effect.log(`Counter value: ${value}`);
});
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Ref` is an atomic, mutable reference for effectful and concurrent code.
- All operations are safe, composable, and free of race conditions.
- Use `Ref` for counters, caches, or any shared mutable state.

---

## Modeling Effect Results with Exit

Use Exit to capture the outcome of an Effect, including success, failure, and defects, for robust error handling and coordination.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Exit } from "effect";

// Run an Effect and capture its Exit value
const program = Effect.succeed(42);

const runAndCapture = Effect.runPromiseExit(program); // Promise<Exit<never, number>>

// Pattern match on Exit
runAndCapture.then((exit) => {
  if (Exit.isSuccess(exit)) {
    console.log("Success:", exit.value);
  } else if (Exit.isFailure(exit)) {
    console.error("Failure:", exit.cause);
  }
});
```

**Explanation:**  
- `Exit` captures both success (`Exit.success(value)`) and failure (`Exit.failure(cause)`).
- Use `Exit` for robust error handling, supervision, and coordination of concurrent effects.
- Pattern matching on `Exit` lets you handle all possible outcomes.

---

## Poll for Status Until a Task Completes

Use Effect.race to run a repeating polling task that is automatically interrupted when a main task completes.

### Example

This program simulates a long-running data processing job. While it's running, a separate effect polls for its status every 2 seconds. When the main job finishes after 10 seconds, the polling automatically stops.

```typescript
import { Effect, Schedule, Duration } from "effect";

// The main task that takes a long time to complete
const longRunningJob = Effect.log("Data processing complete!").pipe(
  Effect.delay(Duration.seconds(10)),
);

// The polling task that checks the status
const pollStatus = Effect.log("Polling for job status: In Progress...");

// A schedule that repeats the polling task every 2 seconds, forever
const pollingSchedule = Schedule.fixed(Duration.seconds(2));

// The complete polling effect that will run indefinitely until interrupted
const repeatingPoller = pollStatus.pipe(Effect.repeat(pollingSchedule));

// Race the main job against the poller.
// The longRunningJob will win after 10 seconds, interrupting the poller.
const program = Effect.race(longRunningJob, repeatingPoller);

Effect.runPromise(program);
/*
Output:
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Polling for job status: In Progress...
Data processing complete!
*/
```

---

## Process a Collection in Parallel with Effect.forEach

Use Effect.forEach with the `concurrency` option to process a collection in parallel with a fixed limit.

### Example

Imagine you have a list of 100 user IDs and you need to fetch the data for each one. `Effect.forEach` with a concurrency of 10 will process them in controlled parallel batches.

```typescript
import { Clock, Effect } from "effect";

// Mock function to simulate fetching a user by ID
const fetchUserById = (id: number) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    yield* Effect.logInfo(`Fetching user ${id}...`);
    yield* Effect.sleep("1 second"); // Simulate network delay
    return { id, name: `User ${id}`, email: `user${id}@example.com` };
  });

const userIds = Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => i + 1);

// Process the entire array, but only run 5 fetches at a time.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Starting parallel processing...");

  const startTime = yield* Clock.currentTimeMillis;
  const users = yield* Effect.forEach(userIds, fetchUserById, {
    concurrency: 5, // Limit to 5 concurrent operations
  });
  const endTime = yield* Clock.currentTimeMillis;

  yield* Effect.logInfo(
    `Processed ${users.length} users in ${endTime - startTime}ms`
  );
  yield* Effect.logInfo(
    `First few users: ${JSON.stringify(users.slice(0, 3), null, 2)}`
  );

  return users;
});

// The result will be an array of all user objects.
// The total time will be much less than running them sequentially.
Effect.runPromise(program);

```

---

## Race Concurrent Effects for the Fastest Result

Use Effect.race to get the result from the first of several effects to succeed, automatically interrupting the losers.

### Example

A classic use case is checking a fast cache before falling back to a slower database. We can race the cache lookup against the database query.

```typescript
import { Effect, Option } from "effect";

type User = { id: number; name: string };

// Simulate a slower cache lookup that might find nothing (None)
const checkCache: Effect.Effect<Option.Option<User>> = Effect.succeed(
  Option.none()
).pipe(
  Effect.delay("200 millis") // Made slower so database wins
);

// Simulate a faster database query that will always find the data
const queryDatabase: Effect.Effect<Option.Option<User>> = Effect.succeed(
  Option.some({ id: 1, name: "Paul" })
).pipe(
  Effect.delay("50 millis") // Made faster so it wins the race
);

// Race them. The database should win and return the user data.
const program = Effect.race(checkCache, queryDatabase).pipe(
  // The result of the race is an Option, so we can handle it.
  Effect.flatMap((result: Option.Option<User>) =>
    Option.match(result, {
      onNone: () => Effect.fail("User not found anywhere."),
      onSome: (user) => Effect.succeed(user),
    })
  )
);

// In this case, the database wins the race.
const programWithResults = Effect.gen(function* () {
  try {
    const user = yield* program;
    yield* Effect.log(`User found: ${JSON.stringify(user)}`);
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    yield* Effect.logError(`Error: ${error}`);
    throw error;
  }
}).pipe(
  Effect.catchAll((error) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* Effect.logError(`Handled error: ${error}`);
      return null;
    })
  )
);

Effect.runPromise(programWithResults);

// Also demonstrate with logging
const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logInfo("Starting race between cache and database...");

  try {
    const user = yield* program;
    yield* Effect.logInfo(
      `Success: Found user ${user.name} with ID ${user.id}`
    );
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    yield* Effect.logInfo("This won't be reached due to Effect error handling");
    return null;
  }
}).pipe(
  Effect.catchAll((error) =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* Effect.logInfo(`Handled error: ${error}`);
      return null;
    })
  )
);

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);

```

## Run Background Tasks with Effect.fork

Use Effect.fork to start a non-blocking background process and manage its lifecycle via its Fiber.

### Example

This program forks a background process that logs a "tick" every second. The main process does its own work for 5 seconds and then explicitly interrupts the background logger before exiting.

```typescript
import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect";

// A long-running effect that logs a message every second, forever
// Effect.forever creates an infinite loop that repeats the effect
// This simulates a background service like a health check or monitoring task
const tickingClock = Effect.log("tick").pipe(
  Effect.delay("1 second"), // Wait 1 second between ticks
  Effect.forever, // Repeat indefinitely - this creates an infinite effect
);

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("Forking the ticking clock into the background.");
  
  // Start the clock, but don't wait for it.
  // Effect.fork creates a new fiber that runs concurrently with the main program
  // The main fiber continues immediately without waiting for the background task
  // This is essential for non-blocking background operations
  const clockFiber = yield* Effect.fork(tickingClock);
  
  // At this point, we have two fibers running:
  // 1. The main fiber (this program)
  // 2. The background clock fiber (ticking every second)

  yield* Effect.log("Main process is now doing other work for 5 seconds...");
  
  // Simulate the main application doing work
  // While this sleep happens, the background clock continues ticking
  // This demonstrates true concurrency - both fibers run simultaneously
  yield* Effect.sleep("5 seconds");

  yield* Effect.log("Main process is done. Interrupting the clock fiber.");
  
  // Stop the background process.
  // Fiber.interrupt sends an interruption signal to the fiber
  // This allows the fiber to perform cleanup operations before terminating
  // Without this, the background task would continue running indefinitely
  yield* Fiber.interrupt(clockFiber);
  
  // Important: Always clean up background fibers to prevent resource leaks
  // In a real application, you might want to:
  // 1. Use Fiber.join instead of interrupt to wait for graceful completion
  // 2. Handle interruption signals within the background task
  // 3. Implement proper shutdown procedures

  yield* Effect.log("Program finished.");
  
  // Key concepts demonstrated:
  // 1. Fork creates concurrent fibers without blocking
  // 2. Background tasks run independently of the main program
  // 3. Fiber interruption provides controlled shutdown
  // 4. Multiple fibers can run simultaneously on the same thread pool
});

// This example shows how to:
// - Run background tasks that don't block the main program
// - Manage fiber lifecycles (create, run, interrupt)
// - Coordinate between multiple concurrent operations
// - Properly clean up resources when shutting down
Effect.runPromise(program);
```

## Run Independent Effects in Parallel with Effect.all

Use Effect.all to execute a collection of independent effects concurrently.

### Example

Imagine fetching a user's profile and their latest posts from two different API endpoints. These are independent operations and can be run in parallel to save time.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Simulate fetching a user, takes 1 second
const fetchUser = Effect.succeed({ id: 1, name: "Paul" }).pipe(
  Effect.delay("1 second"),
);

// Simulate fetching posts, takes 1.5 seconds
const fetchPosts = Effect.succeed([{ title: "Effect is great" }]).pipe(
  Effect.delay("1.5 seconds"),
);

// Run both effects concurrently - must specify concurrency option!
const program = Effect.all([fetchUser, fetchPosts], { concurrency: "unbounded" });

// The resulting effect will succeed with a tuple: [{id, name}, [{title}]]
// Total execution time will be ~1.5 seconds (the duration of the longest task).
const programWithLogging = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const results = yield* program;
  yield* Effect.log(`Results: ${JSON.stringify(results)}`);
  return results;
});

Effect.runPromise(programWithLogging);
```

## Understand Fibers as Lightweight Threads

Understand that a Fiber is a lightweight, virtual thread managed by the Effect runtime for massive concurrency.

### Example

This program demonstrates the efficiency of fibers by forking 100,000 of them. Each fiber does a small amount of work (sleeping for 1 second). Trying to do this with 100,000 OS threads would instantly crash any system.

```typescript
import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Demonstrate the lightweight nature of fibers by creating 100,000 of them
  // This would be impossible with OS threads due to memory and context switching overhead
  const fiberCount = 100_000;
  yield* Effect.log(`Forking ${fiberCount} fibers...`);

  // Create an array of 100,000 simple effects
  // Each effect sleeps for 1 second and then returns its index
  // This simulates lightweight concurrent tasks
  const tasks = Array.from({ length: fiberCount }, (_, i) =>
    Effect.sleep("1 second").pipe(Effect.as(i))
  );

  // Fork all of them into background fibers
  // Effect.fork creates a new fiber for each task without blocking
  // This demonstrates fiber creation scalability - 100k fibers created almost instantly
  // Each fiber is much lighter than an OS thread (typically ~1KB vs ~8MB per thread)
  const fibers = yield* Effect.forEach(tasks, Effect.fork);

  yield* Effect.log(
    "All fibers have been forked. Now waiting for them to complete..."
  );

  // Wait for all fibers to finish their work
  // Fiber.joinAll waits for all fibers to complete and collects their results
  // This demonstrates fiber coordination - managing thousands of concurrent operations
  // The runtime efficiently schedules these fibers using a work-stealing thread pool
  const results = yield* Fiber.joinAll(fibers);

  yield* Effect.log(`All ${results.length} fibers have completed.`);

  // Key insights from this example:
  // 1. Fibers are extremely lightweight - 100k fibers use minimal memory
  // 2. Fiber creation is fast - no expensive OS thread allocation
  // 3. The Effect runtime efficiently schedules fibers across available CPU cores
  // 4. Fibers can be suspended and resumed without blocking OS threads
  // 5. This enables massive concurrency for I/O-bound operations
});

// This program runs successfully, demonstrating the low overhead of fibers.
// Try running this with OS threads - you'd likely hit system limits around 1000-10000 threads
// With fibers, 100k+ concurrent operations are easily achievable
Effect.runPromise(program);
