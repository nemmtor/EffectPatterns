# Resource Management Patterns

## Compose Resource Lifecycles with `Layer.merge`

Compose multiple scoped layers using `Layer.merge` or by providing one layer to another.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Console } from "effect";

// --- Service 1: Database ---
interface DatabaseOps {
  query: (sql: string) => Effect.Effect<string, never, never>;
}

class Database extends Effect.Service<DatabaseOps>()(
  "Database",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      query: (sql: string): Effect.Effect<string, never, never> =>
        Effect.sync(() => `db says: ${sql}`)
    })
  }
) {}

// --- Service 2: API Client ---
interface ApiClientOps {
  fetch: (path: string) => Effect.Effect<string, never, never>;
}

class ApiClient extends Effect.Service<ApiClientOps>()(
  "ApiClient",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      fetch: (path: string): Effect.Effect<string, never, never> =>
        Effect.sync(() => `api says: ${path}`)
    })
  }
) {}

// --- Application Layer ---
// We merge the two independent layers into one.
const AppLayer = Layer.merge(Database.Default, ApiClient.Default);

// This program uses both services, unaware of their implementation details.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;
  const api = yield* ApiClient;

  const dbResult = yield* db.query("SELECT *");
  const apiResult = yield* api.fetch("/users");

  yield* Effect.log(dbResult);
  yield* Effect.log(apiResult);
});

// Provide the combined layer to the program.
Effect.runPromise(Effect.provide(program, AppLayer));

/*
Output (note the LIFO release order):
Database pool opened
API client session started
db says: SELECT *
api says: /users
API client session ended
Database pool closed
*/
```

**Explanation:**
We define two completely independent services, `Database` and `ApiClient`, each with its own resource lifecycle. By combining them with `Layer.merge`, we create a single `AppLayer`. When `program` runs, Effect acquires the resources for both layers. When `program` finishes, Effect closes the application's scope, releasing the resources in the reverse order they were acquired (`ApiClient` then `Database`), ensuring a clean and predictable shutdown.

## Create a Managed Runtime for Scoped Resources

Create a managed runtime for scoped resources.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";

class DatabasePool extends Effect.Service<DatabasePool>()(
  "DbPool",
  {
    effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* Effect.log("Acquiring pool");
      return {
        query: () => Effect.succeed("result")
      };
    })
  }
) {}

// Create a program that uses the DatabasePool service
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* DatabasePool;
  yield* Effect.log("Using DB");
  yield* db.query();
});

// Run the program with the service implementation
Effect.runPromise(
  program.pipe(
    Effect.provide(DatabasePool.Default),
    Effect.scoped
  )
);
```

**Explanation:**  
`Layer.launch` ensures that resources are acquired and released safely, even
in the event of errors or interruptions.

---

## Create a Service Layer from a Managed Resource

Provide a managed resource to the application context using `Layer.scoped`.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Console } from "effect";

// 1. Define the service interface
interface DatabaseService {
  readonly query: (sql: string) => Effect.Effect<string[], never, never>
}

// 2. Define the service implementation with scoped resource management
class Database extends Effect.Service<DatabaseService>()(
  "Database",
  {
    // The scoped property manages the resource lifecycle
    scoped: Effect.gen(function* () {
      const id = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
      
      // Acquire the connection
      yield* Effect.log(`[Pool ${id}] Acquired`);
      
      // Setup cleanup to run when scope closes
      yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Effect.log(`[Pool ${id}] Released`));
      
      // Return the service implementation
      return {
        query: (sql: string) => Effect.sync(() => 
          [`Result for '${sql}' from pool ${id}`]
        )
      };
    })
  }
) {}

// 3. Use the service in your program
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;
  const users = yield* db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
  yield* Effect.log(`Query successful: ${users[0]}`);
});

// 4. Run the program with scoped resource management
Effect.runPromise(
  Effect.scoped(program).pipe(
    Effect.provide(Database.Default)
  )
);

/*
Output:
[Pool 458] Acquired
Query successful: Result for 'SELECT * FROM users' from pool 458
[Pool 458] Released
*/
```

**Explanation:**
The `Effect.Service` helper creates the `Database` class, which acts as both the service definition and its context key (Tag). The `Database.Live` layer connects this service to a concrete, lifecycle-managed implementation. When `program` asks for the `Database` service, the Effect runtime uses the `Live` layer to run the `acquire` effect once, caches the resulting `DbPool`, and injects it. The `release` effect is automatically run when the program completes.

## Implement Graceful Shutdown for Your Application

Use Effect.runFork and OS signal listeners to implement graceful shutdown for long-running applications.

### Example

This example creates a server with a "scoped" database connection. It uses `runFork` to start the server and sets up a `SIGINT` handler to interrupt the server fiber, which in turn guarantees the database finalizer is called.

```typescript
import { Effect, Layer, Fiber, Context, Scope } from "effect";
import * as http from "http";

// 1. A service with a finalizer for cleanup
class Database extends Effect.Service<Database>()("Database", {
  effect: Effect.gen(function* () {
    yield* Effect.log("Acquiring DB connection");
    return {
      query: () => Effect.succeed("data"),
    };
  }),
}) {}

// 2. The main server logic
const server = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const db = yield* Database;

  // Create server with proper error handling
  const httpServer = yield* Effect.sync(() => {
    const server = http.createServer((_req, res) => {
      Effect.runFork(
        Effect.provide(
          db.query().pipe(Effect.map((data) => res.end(data))),
          Database.Default
        )
      );
    });
    return server;
  });

  // Add a finalizer to close the server
  yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() =>
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      httpServer.close();
      yield* Effect.log("Server closed");
    })
  );

  // Start server with error handling
  yield* Effect.async<void, Error>((resume) => {
    httpServer.once('error', (err: Error) => {
      resume(Effect.fail(new Error(`Failed to start server: ${err.message}`)));
    });

    httpServer.listen(3456, () => {
      resume(Effect.succeed(void 0));
    });
  });

  yield* Effect.log("Server started on port 3456. Press Ctrl+C to exit.");

  // For testing purposes, we'll run for a short time instead of forever
  yield* Effect.sleep("2 seconds");
  yield* Effect.log("Shutting down gracefully...");
});

// 3. Provide the layer and launch with runFork
const app = Effect.provide(server.pipe(Effect.scoped), Database.Default);

// 4. Run the app and handle shutdown
Effect.runPromise(app).catch((error) => {
  Effect.runSync(Effect.logError("Application error: " + error));
  process.exit(1);
});

```

## Manage Resource Lifecycles with Scope

Use Scope for fine-grained, manual control over resource lifecycles and cleanup guarantees.

### Example

This example shows how to acquire a resource (like a file handle), use it, and have `Scope` guarantee its release.

```typescript
import { Effect, Scope } from "effect";

// Simulate acquiring and releasing a resource
const acquireFile = Effect.log("File opened").pipe(
  Effect.as({ write: (data: string) => Effect.log(`Wrote: ${data}`) }),
);
const releaseFile = Effect.log("File closed.");

// Create a "scoped" effect. This effect, when used, will acquire the
// resource and register its release action with the current scope.
const scopedFile = Effect.acquireRelease(acquireFile, () => releaseFile);

// The main program that uses the scoped resource
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Effect.scoped "uses" the resource. It runs the acquire effect,
  // provides the resource to the inner effect, and ensures the
  // release effect is run when this block completes.
  const file = yield* Effect.scoped(scopedFile);

  yield* file.write("hello");
  yield* file.write("world");

  // The file will be automatically closed here.
});

Effect.runPromise(program);
/*
Output:
File opened
Wrote: hello
Wrote: world
File closed
*/
```

## Manually Manage Lifecycles with `Scope`

Use `Effect.scope` and `Scope.addFinalizer` for fine-grained control over resource cleanup.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Console } from "effect";

// Mocking a complex file operation
const openFile = (path: string) =>
  Effect.succeed({ path, handle: Math.random() }).pipe(
    Effect.tap((f) => Effect.log(`Opened ${f.path}`)),
  );
const createTempFile = (path: string) =>
  Effect.succeed({ path: `${path}.tmp`, handle: Math.random() }).pipe(
    Effect.tap((f) => Effect.log(`Created temp file ${f.path}`)),
  );
const closeFile = (file: { path: string }) =>
  Effect.sync(() => Effect.log(`Closed ${file.path}`));
const deleteFile = (file: { path: string }) =>
  Effect.sync(() => Effect.log(`Deleted ${file.path}`));

// This program acquires two resources (a file and a temp file)
// and ensures both are cleaned up correctly using acquireRelease.
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const file = yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
    openFile("data.csv"),
    (f) => closeFile(f)
  );

  const tempFile = yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
    createTempFile("data.csv"),
    (f) => deleteFile(f)
  );

  yield* Effect.log("...writing data from temp file to main file...");
});

// Run the program with a scope
Effect.runPromise(Effect.scoped(program));

/*
Output (note the LIFO cleanup order):
Opened data.csv
Created temp file data.csv.tmp
...writing data from temp file to main file...
Deleted data.csv.tmp
Closed data.csv
*/
```

**Explanation:**
`Effect.scope` creates a new `Scope` and provides it to the `program`. Inside `program`, we access this `Scope` and use `addFinalizer` to register cleanup actions immediately after acquiring each resource. When `Effect.scope` finishes executing `program`, it closes the scope, which in turn executes all registered finalizers in the reverse order of their addition.

---

## Safely Bracket Resource Usage with `acquireRelease`

Bracket the use of a resource between an `acquire` and a `release` effect.

### Example

```typescript
import { Effect, Console } from "effect";

// A mock resource that needs to be managed
const getDbConnection = Effect.sync(() => ({ id: Math.random() })).pipe(
  Effect.tap(() => Effect.log("Connection Acquired")),
);

const closeDbConnection = (conn: { id: number }): Effect.Effect<void, never, never> =>
  Effect.log(`Connection ${conn.id} Released`);

// The program that uses the resource
const program = Effect.acquireRelease(
  getDbConnection, // 1. acquire
  (connection) => closeDbConnection(connection) // 2. cleanup
).pipe(
  Effect.tap((connection) =>
    Effect.log(`Using connection ${connection.id} to run query...`)
  )
);

Effect.runPromise(Effect.scoped(program));

/*
Output:
Connection Acquired
Using connection 0.12345... to run query...
Connection 0.12345... Released
*/
```

**Explanation:**
By using `Effect.acquireRelease`, the `closeDbConnection` logic is guaranteed to run after the main logic completes. This creates a self-contained, leak-proof unit of work that can be safely composed into larger programs.
