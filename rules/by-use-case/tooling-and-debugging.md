# Tooling and Debugging Patterns

## Supercharge Your Editor with the Effect LSP

Install and use the Effect LSP extension for enhanced type information and error checking in your editor.

### Example

Imagine you have the following code. Without the LSP, hovering over `program` might show a complex, hard-to-read inferred type.

```typescript
import { Effect } from "effect";

// Define Logger service using Effect.Service pattern
class Logger extends Effect.Service<Logger>()(
  "Logger",
  {
    sync: () => ({
      log: (msg: string) => Effect.log(`LOG: ${msg}`)
    })
  }
) {}

const program = Effect.succeed(42).pipe(
  Effect.map((n) => n.toString()),
  Effect.flatMap((s) => Effect.log(s)),
  Effect.provide(Logger.Default)
);

// Run the program
Effect.runPromise(program);
```

With the Effect LSP installed, your editor would display a clear, readable overlay right above the `program` variable, looking something like this:

```
// (LSP Inlay Hint)
// program: Effect<void, never, never>
```

This immediately tells you that the final program returns nothing (`void`), has no expected failures (`never`), and has no remaining requirements (`never`), so it's ready to be run.

## Teach your AI Agents Effect with the MCP Server

Use the MCP server to provide live application context to AI coding agents, enabling more accurate assistance.

### Example

The "Good Example" is the workflow this pattern enables.

1.  **You run the MCP server** in your terminal, pointing it at your main `AppLayer`.
    ```bash
    npx @effect/mcp-server --layer src/layers.ts:AppLayer
    ```

2.  **You configure your AI agent** (e.g., Cursor) to use the MCP server's endpoint (`http://localhost:3333`).

3.  **You ask the AI a question** that requires deep context about your app:
    > "Refactor this code to use the `UserService` to fetch a user by ID and log the result with the `Logger`."

4.  **The AI, in the background, queries the MCP server:**
    -   It discovers that `UserService` and `Logger` are available in the `AppLayer`.
    -   It retrieves the exact method signature for `UserService.getUser` and `Logger.log`.

5.  **The AI generates correct, context-aware code** because it's not guessing; it's using the live architectural information provided by the MCP server.

```typescript
// The AI generates this correct code:
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { UserService } from "./features/User/UserService.js";
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const userService = yield* UserService;

  const user = yield* userService.getUser("123");
  yield* Effect.log(`Found user: ${user.name}`);
});

```
