# Run Background Tasks with Effect.fork
**Rule:** Use Effect.fork to start a non-blocking background process and manage its lifecycle via its Fiber.

### Example
This program forks a background process that logs a "tick" every second. The main process does its own work for 5 seconds and then explicitly interrupts the background logger before exiting.

```typescript
import { Effect, Fiber } from "effect";

// A long-running effect that logs a message every second, forever
// Effect.forever creates an infinite loop that repeats the effect
// This simulates a background service like a health check or monitoring task
const tickingClock = Effect.log("tick").pipe(
  Effect.delay("1 second"), // Wait 1 second between ticks
  Effect.forever, // Repeat indefinitely - this creates an infinite effect
);

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("Forking the ticking clock into the background.");
  
  // Start the clock, but don't wait for it.
  // Effect.fork creates a new fiber that runs concurrently with the main program
  // The main fiber continues immediately without waiting for the background task
  // This is essential for non-blocking background operations
  const clockFiber = yield* Effect.fork(tickingClock);
  
  // At this point, we have two fibers running:
  // 1. The main fiber (this program)
  // 2. The background clock fiber (ticking every second)

  yield* Effect.log("Main process is now doing other work for 5 seconds...");
  
  // Simulate the main application doing work
  // While this sleep happens, the background clock continues ticking
  // This demonstrates true concurrency - both fibers run simultaneously
  yield* Effect.sleep("5 seconds");

  yield* Effect.log("Main process is done. Interrupting the clock fiber.");
  
  // Stop the background process.
  // Fiber.interrupt sends an interruption signal to the fiber
  // This allows the fiber to perform cleanup operations before terminating
  // Without this, the background task would continue running indefinitely
  yield* Fiber.interrupt(clockFiber);
  
  // Important: Always clean up background fibers to prevent resource leaks
  // In a real application, you might want to:
  // 1. Use Fiber.join instead of interrupt to wait for graceful completion
  // 2. Handle interruption signals within the background task
  // 3. Implement proper shutdown procedures

  yield* Effect.log("Program finished.");
  
  // Key concepts demonstrated:
  // 1. Fork creates concurrent fibers without blocking
  // 2. Background tasks run independently of the main program
  // 3. Fiber interruption provides controlled shutdown
  // 4. Multiple fibers can run simultaneously on the same thread pool
});

// This example shows how to:
// - Run background tasks that don't block the main program
// - Manage fiber lifecycles (create, run, interrupt)
// - Coordinate between multiple concurrent operations
// - Properly clean up resources when shutting down
Effect.runPromise(program);
```

**Explanation:**  
Unlike `Effect.all` or a direct `yield*`, which wait for the computation to complete, `Effect.fork` is a "fire and forget" operation. It starts the effect on a new, concurrent fiber and immediately returns control to the parent fiber.

This is essential for managing long-running background tasks like:
-   A web server listener.
-   A message queue consumer.
-   A periodic cache cleanup job.

The returned `Fiber` object is your remote control for the background task. You can use `Fiber.interrupt` to safely stop it (ensuring all its finalizers are run) or `Fiber.join` to wait for it to complete at some later point.
